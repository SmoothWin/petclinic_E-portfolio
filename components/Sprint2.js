<p>The story point estimation for this sprint was done correctly where the easiest stories we ranked from 3 and below and because they werenâ€™t considered very important.</p>
<p>For the jacoco story the story point given to it was self-explanatory. The library implementation was paramount and must be taken care of as quickly as possible to deliver the code coverage library to all our vet service developer. Also, the test additions and refactoring took a lot of time to get this story done.</p>

        <Section title="Version Control">
          <p>For version control we mainly used git hub. Each of one of my stories were pulled from main on a separate branch with the proposed naming convention.</p>

          <ImageContainer imageSrc={"images/sprint2/branch2.png"}/>
          <ImageContainer imageSrc={"images/sprint2/branch3.png"}/>
          <p>In this sprint, the use of commits was done more often and pushes done under the same standard I used for the first sprint. 
            <p>For main features of the story such as methods and changes I always finish with commits and push when I am done for the feature, take a break or plan to continue my work in another environment.
              </p>
            </p>
          <p>Pull requests were made and used with the proposed naming convention with the addition of the vets label for better pull request search.</p>

        <Section title="Test Driven Development">
        <p>In regards of TDD implementation during this sprint, I had to write alot of lines of code in order to fix and add alot of tests in order for all of them to do follow the right testing implementation.
           All of the tests are well documented through this pull request </p>

        <p>Unit tests are done with high quality except for a few instances where we use the same mock data accross a few tests that were considered useless (the same reoccuring vet entity instantiation and setting of data) as seen on this

          <br/>Other than this small issue, the tests were developed with good quality in mind respecting the core reasoning and use of the tests created.</p>

        <p>With the addition of the Jacoco code coverage library, in this sprint I had to at least implement enough tests to have a code coverage to cover 90%.</p>
        <p>Code coverage is above 90% but not 100% because my job was to implement the Jacoco library and add enough tests in order for Jacoco to make the build work.</p>
